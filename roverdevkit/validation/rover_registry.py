"""Published-rover design vectors and mission scenarios.

This module codifies the lunar rovers we compare the evaluator and the
surrogate against (project_plan.md §6 W5 + §6 W6) as
:class:`DesignVector` + :class:`MissionScenario` pairs, plus the
published truth numbers in ``data/published_traverse_data.csv``.

Two-tier registry
-----------------
The registry is split into two tiers via :attr:`RoverRegistryEntry.is_flown`:

- **Flown** (``is_flown=True``): rovers with actual ground-truth flight
  data. Used by:

  * Layer-0 truth comparison (Week 5 acceptance gate,
    :func:`roverdevkit.validation.rover_comparison.compare_all`),
    which scores the evaluator vs published traverse / peak-solar /
    thermal data.
  * Layer-1 surrogate sanity check (Week 6,
    :func:`roverdevkit.surrogate.baselines.predict_for_registry_rovers`).

  Currently: **Pragyan** (Chandrayaan-3, 2023), **Yutu-2** (Chang'e-4,
  2019).

- **Design-target** (``is_flown=False``): well-spec'd lunar micro-rover
  designs that did not fly (lander loss or still in development). Used
  only for Layer-1 surrogate sanity. Layer-0 truth comparison is
  skipped because there's no ground-truth flight data.

  Currently: **MoonRanger** (CMU/Astrobotic, in development),
  **Rashid-1** (MBRSC/UAE, lost on Hakuto-R Mission 1, 2023).

Helpers:

- :func:`registry`        — all entries (flown + design-target).
- :func:`flown_registry`  — flown subset (Layer-0 use).
- :func:`registry_by_name` — single lookup, all tiers.

Scope decisions
---------------
- **Sojourner removed (2026-04-25).** Was a Mars-gravity sentinel; its
  multiple OOD-ness in the surrogate's design / scenario / gravity
  space made it counterproductive for the Layer-1 sanity check.
  Project narrowed to lunar micro-rover scope.
- **Iris not added.** Battery-only rover (no solar array) violates the
  surrogate's energy-architecture assumptions; would require a schema
  extension to model honestly.
- **Not a tradespace input.** These scenarios live next to the canonical
  four in :data:`SCENARIO_DIR` but are excluded from
  :func:`list_scenarios` so Phase-3 sweeps never pick them up.

Every design-vector field that is not directly published has an entry
in :attr:`RoverRegistryEntry.imputation_notes`; these notes mirror the
pattern from the Week-3 mass validation set for consistency.

class RoverRegistryEntry:
    """One rover bundled with the scenario it actually flew (or would have).

    Attributes
    ----------
    rover_name
        Short key used to look up published truth in
        :func:`load_truth_table` (flown rovers only).
    design
        12-D design vector reconstructed from public specs + documented
        imputations.
    scenario
        Mission context matching the real rover's operating environment
        (or its design-target landing site for non-flown entries).
    gravity_m_per_s2
        Passed through to the evaluator as ``gravity_m_per_s2``. Lunar
        for all current entries (the Mars-gravity Sojourner sentinel
        was removed when the project narrowed to lunar micro-rovers).
    thermal_architecture
        Per-rover thermal model (RHU power, surface area, hibernation
        load, sink temperatures) capturing the rover's actual thermal
        design rather than a generic default.
    panel_efficiency
        DC-level conversion efficiency at the rover's operating point.
        Distinct from the tradespace-default 0.28 (GaAs triple-junction
        beginning-of-life) because real rovers use different cell techs
        and see end-of-life degradation that the default doesn't model.
    panel_dust_factor
        Mission-integrated dust-transmission factor in (0, 1].
        Rover-specific because real dust accumulation is highly
        mission-dependent; lunar day-1 values differ from steady-state.
    is_flown
        Whether the rover successfully deployed and produced
        ground-truth flight data. Drives whether the entry participates
        in the Layer-0 truth comparison (see module docstring).
    imputation_notes
        Per-field notes on which design-vector entries were imputed and
        how.

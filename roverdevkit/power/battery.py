"""Battery state-of-charge model with efficiency and temperature derating.

Coulomb-counting SOC update with:
    - separate charge/discharge round-trip efficiencies,
    - depth-of-discharge floor (don't drain below ``min_state_of_charge``),
    - upper SOC clamp at 1.0 (no over-charge),
    - simple piecewise-linear temperature derating of usable capacity.

Calibration / references
------------------------
Smart, M. C. et al. *Lithium-ion electrolytes for low-temperature
operation of NASA missions*. JPL/NASA reports (multiple 2003-2018);
summarised in Halpert & Surampudi (NASA Glenn) battery technology
overviews. The piecewise-linear capacity vs temperature curve below is a
deliberately coarse fit to those datasets - good enough for tradespace
sizing where battery thermal control keeps cells within ~5-30 C - and
flagged here so it can be swapped for a vendor-specific curve later.

Larson & Wertz, *SMAD* 3rd ed., Ch. 11, gives the conventional
``E_usable = E_nominal * (1 - DoD_floor) * eta_round_trip`` accounting
that we follow.

Validation (Week 2)
-------------------
Confirm that the default model (``min_state_of_charge = 0.15``,
``charge_efficiency = discharge_efficiency = 0.95``, T = 20 C) returns
~85 Wh usable for a 100 Wh nominal pack; see ``tests/test_power.py``.

    """Advance the battery state by one time step.

    Parameters
    ----------
    state
        Current battery state. Not mutated; a fresh ``BatteryState`` is
        returned with the updated SOC.
    power_net_w
        Net power flowing *into* the battery over the step, W.
        Positive = net charging (solar > load), negative = net discharge
        (load > solar).
    dt_s
        Time step length, s. Must be non-negative.

    Returns
    -------
    BatteryState
        New state with ``state_of_charge`` advanced and clamped to
        ``[min_state_of_charge, 1.0]``.

    Notes
    -----
    Energy book-keeping (SMAD-style):

        if charging:    dE_stored = P_net * eta_charge * dt
        if discharging: dE_stored = P_net / eta_discharge * dt        (P_net < 0)

    The asymmetric efficiency placement is deliberate: when charging, only
    a fraction ``eta_charge`` of bus energy lands in the cells; when
    discharging, the cells must give up ``|P_load| / eta_discharge`` to
    deliver ``|P_load|`` to the load. The combined round-trip ratio is
    therefore ``eta_charge * eta_discharge``.

    The clamp at ``min_state_of_charge`` and ``1.0`` silently caps energy
    flow; a separate constraint flag in the mission evaluator
    (``MissionMetrics.energy_margin_pct``) records how often the clamp
    activates.

"""Derived mobility capabilities computed from the Bekker-Wong model.

Right now this contains one thing: the **maximum climbable slope** for a
rover design on a given soil. This is separate from the traverse sim
because it's a static capability metric (not time-resolved) and it
populates ``MissionMetrics.slope_capability_deg`` (project_plan.md §2, §3.2
scenario 3).

Approach
--------
For a rover traversing a slope of inclination theta, at steady speed:

    Tractive force required per wheel = m*g*sin(theta) / n_wheels
    Normal load per wheel              = m*g*cos(theta) / n_wheels

The Bekker-Wong model's ``drawbar_pull_n`` is the *net* horizontal force
a single wheel delivers beyond its own motion resistance, so DP must
balance the gradient term alone. At each candidate slope we evaluate
:func:`single_wheel_forces` at a reference high-slip point
(``max_slip``) to get the maximum available DP and look for the slope
at which available DP equals required DP.

We cap the search at 35 deg because (a) the :class:`MissionScenario`
schema allows ``max_slope_deg <= 35`` and (b) at that slope rover
stability (tip-over) starts to dominate over traction, which this model
ignores.

"""Time-stepped traverse simulator.

Given a rover design, a mission scenario, soil parameters, and the total
vehicle mass, this module marches the rover forward in fixed time steps:
at each step it solves the Bekker-Wong slip balance on the scenario's
slope, draws mobility power from the battery, replenishes from the
solar panel, and logs everything.

The simulator **always runs to the end of the mission duration**; it
does not short-circuit when the battery hits its DoD floor or the
rover stalls. Early termination would throw away information the
surrogate layer (project_plan.md §4) needs to learn failure modes. The
end-of-run constraint flags and ``terminated_reason`` field capture
whatever failures occurred during the run.

Integration notes
-----------------
- At each step we solve ``DP(slip) - DP_required_per_wheel = 0`` via
  :func:`scipy.optimize.brentq` bracketed in ``[-0.9, 0.95]``. If no
  root exists (the slope is unclimbable), slip is pinned at the upper
  bracket and effective forward velocity drops to zero -- the rover
  spins in place, still drawing motor power.
- We apply the design vector's ``drive_duty_cycle`` as a *mission-average*
  scaling on mobility power and forward progress. This is the standard
  tradespace approximation (project_plan.md §4); pinning down a drive
  schedule is deferred to v2.
- Thermal survival is treated as a whole-mission binary flag
  (:mod:`roverdevkit.power.thermal`) rather than a per-step check --
  the lumped-parameter model is steady-state.

Performance (post-W7.7 lift-out, project_log.md 2026-04-26 entry)
-----------
Default ``dt_s = 3600`` (1 hour) gives ~340 steps for a 14-day mission
and ~720 steps for a 30-day mission. The Bekker-Wong slip solve and the
mobility-power calculation are **loop-invariant** under the current
flat-slope / fixed-soil scenario schema (their inputs do not change
across mission steps), so they are computed once *before* the time
loop and reused. Per-step cost in the time loop is therefore dominated
by the cheap solar / battery / kinematic update.

End-to-end mission cost on Apple Silicon (single core):

* analytical path (BW only):                   ~30 ms / mission
* analytical + wheel-level SCM correction:     ~40 ms / mission
* SCM-direct (PyChrono in the wheel-force solve, available via the
  ``force_backend="scm"`` switch for validation only):  ~4 s / mission

The 100× gap between BW + correction and SCM-direct, with W7.7 showing
≥99 % feasibility-flip agreement, is the cost-vs-fidelity result that
makes the wheel-level correction architecture the production choice.

Future scenario schemas that vary slope or soil per mission step will
need to move the lifted-out calls back inside the loop; the
``force_backend`` / ``correction`` plumbing is already structured for
that.

        Bekker-Wong soil parameters for the scenario's ``soil_simulant``.
    total_mass_kg
        Vehicle mass from :mod:`roverdevkit.mass`.
    dt_s, motor_efficiency, panel_efficiency, panel_dust_factor
        Simulator knobs with project-plan defaults (see module constants).
    panel_tilt_deg, panel_azimuth_deg
        Geometry of the rover's solar array. Default is a horizontal
        top-mounted panel.
    initial_soc
        Battery state-of-charge at t=0. Default 1.0 (fully charged at
        mission start).
    battery_min_soc
        DoD floor forwarded to :class:`BatteryState`.
    gravity_m_per_s2
        Surface gravity (default lunar).
    declination_deg, noon_hour_offset
        Sun geometry controls; see :mod:`roverdevkit.power.solar`.
    correction
        Optional wheel-level SCM correction artifact. When provided
        (and ``force_backend != "scm"``), BW outputs are augmented by
        ``correction.predict_array(...)`` at the slip-balance solve.
        ``None`` (default) preserves the analytical BW-only path.
    force_backend
        Wheel-level force backend selector for the Week-7.7 bake-off:
        ``"bw"`` (default) uses Bekker-Wong, optionally augmented by
        ``correction``; ``"scm"`` calls the PyChrono SCM single-wheel

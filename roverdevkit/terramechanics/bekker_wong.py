"""Analytical terramechanics: Bekker-Wong pressure-sinkage + Janosi-Hanamoto shear.

Single-wheel drawbar pull, sinkage, and driving torque as a function of
wheel geometry, vertical load, slip, and soil parameters.

Model overview
--------------
A rigid wheel of radius ``R`` and width ``b`` sinks a depth ``z_0`` into
deformable soil. Under the contact patch (bounded by entry angle θ₁ and
exit angle θ₂, with θ₂ = 0 for a rigid wheel by Wong's standard
convention) the soil exerts a radial normal stress σ(θ) and a
tangential shear stress τ(θ). Integrating these stresses around the
contact patch yields the vertical load W, drawbar pull DP, and
driving torque T. The entry angle θ₁ is pinned by the constraint that
the integrated vertical force balances the applied load.

  interaction). [unified textbook treatment; reference for all the
  equations used here]

Assumptions
-----------
- Rigid wheel (no tire deflection).
- Exit angle θ₂ = 0 (Wong's standard assumption — the soil rebounds
  elastically behind the wheel and contributes nothing to the net
  stress). More elaborate treatments (Ishigami 2007) let θ₂ < 0 with
  an explicit bulldozing contribution; deferred to the SCM layer.
- Transition angle for peak stress θ_m = (c₁ + c₂·|s|)·θ₁ with
  c₁ = 0.4, c₂ = 0.2. These are Wong's typical empirical defaults;
  Ding 2011 reports soil-dependent fits spanning c₁ ∈ [0.18, 0.43],
  c₂ ∈ [0.09, 0.25]. Residuals go into the Path-2 correction layer.
- Grousers contribute a multiplicative shear-thrust lift derived
  from Iizuka & Kubota 2011 (see ``_grouser_shear_lift``). The term
  is closed-form in (R, N_g, h_g) and saturates at large grouser
  packs; residuals against PyChrono SCM are absorbed by the Path-2
  correction layer.

Validation roadmap (see ``data/validation/README.md``)

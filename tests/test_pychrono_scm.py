"""Week-2 PyChrono SCM single-wheel driver tests.

Purpose: validate that ``pychrono_scm.single_wheel_forces_scm`` is
*wired correctly* — i.e., that the rig produces forces that satisfy
basic physics (Fz balance, monotonic DP with slip, correct sign
conventions) and that the numbers land in the same order of
magnitude as the analytical Bekker-Wong model.

This is **not** a validation-against-truth test — SCM and analytical
Bekker-Wong are both models, not ground truth, and the gap between
them is exactly what the Week-5 correction layer is meant to learn.

The tests are marked ``chrono`` (requires PyChrono) and ``slow``
(simulation wall-clock is seconds, not milliseconds), so they are
skipped by default in the fast ``pytest`` loop and run explicitly
via ``pytest -m 'chrono and slow'`` during Week-2 go/no-go review
and any subsequent SCM-related refactor.
